## Description

---

 _Bird-Watchers-Paradise_ is a web application meant to be help users turn their browsers into their best and most-used birding resource.

Spotted a bird? Identify it using the bird watchers paradise catalog that has a detailed explanation of what youâ€™re seeing - allowing you to compare bird's distinct appearance and behavior to your current bird sighting.

Users can further upload their sighting to the bird watchers paradise gallery! Why not share the beauty with fellow bird watchers who can rate your bird watching skills?.

This is a _bird-watchers-paradise_ website with a front-end made using React and a backend made with Active records, Sinatra and Sqlite3. Active Record allowed us to create three models, _User_, _Bird_ and _Sighting_ that could communicate with the tables, _userss_, _birdss_ and _sightings_ in the Sqlite3 database with the help of migrations that I created. In each model there exists a defined Active Record associations for example:

> Bird has_many Sightings and has_many Users.

> Sightings has_one User and has_one Bird.

> User has_many Birds and has_many Sightings.

Sinatra helped in creating api endpoints that could be used by React frontend to get, post, delete and update the birds and its sightings. Through the use of routing methods that Sinatra provided like **get**, **post**, **patch** and **delete** Active Record and Sinatra also provided methods that could be used to initiate a new instance of the classes, _User_, _Bird_ and _RSighting_ and be able to associate them.

The front-end is diployed in [vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting service while the Sinatra is hosted in [heroku](https://heroku.com/).
